Add the specific changes to staging, create a commit, and push to remote.

Follow this checklist for writing your commit message:

- SHOULD use Conventional Commits format: https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0
- SHOULD NOT refer to Claude or Anthropic in the commit message.
- SHOULD structure commit message as follows:
<type>[optional scope]: <description>
[optional body]
[optional footer(s)]
- commit SHOULD contain the following structural elements to communicate intent: 
fix: a commit of the type fix patches a bug in your codebase (this correlates with PATCH in Semantic Versioning).
feat: a commit of the type feat introduces a new feature to the codebase (this correlates with MINOR in Semantic Versioning).
BREAKING CHANGE: a commit that has a footer BREAKING CHANGE:, or appends a ! after the type/scope, introduces a breaking API change (correlating with MAJOR in Semantic Versioning). A BREAKING CHANGE can be part of commits of any type.
types other than fix: and feat: are allowed, for example @commitlint/config-conventional (based on the Angular convention) recommends build:, chore:, ci:, docs:, style:, refactor:, perf:, test:, and others.
footers other than BREAKING CHANGE: <description> may be provided and follow a convention similar to git trailer format
